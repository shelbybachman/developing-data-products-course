This repository contains my materials from the "Developing Data Products" course from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

### Final Project: Predictors of Wine Quality App
For this course, I created a [Shiny app](https://shelbybachman.shinyapps.io/predictors-of-wine-quality/) that explores various predictors of wine quality -- specifically, Portuguese vinho verde. <br>
[Here](https://shelbybachman.github.io/developing-data-products-course/predictors-of-wine-quality/final-project-slides.html) is a slide deck that briefly describes the app.

### Plotting with Leaflet
In the course, I also used Leaflet with R to create an [interactive map](https://shelbybachman.github.io/developing-data-products-course/week2-assignment/week2-assignment.html) of Western US national parks and their visitors in 2018.

### Plotting with Plotly
I also learned to use `plotly` R package for interactive plots. In this [slide deck](https://shelbybachman.github.io/developing-data-products-course/week3-assignment/week3-assignment.html), I created a few interactive plots using visitor data from California's national parks.
